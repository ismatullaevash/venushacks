## Inspiration
We started thinking about our own personal finance backgrounds and challenges and realized we weren’t taught about it in school or from our parents. We came up with the concept of developing an educational application to teach young women, from elementary to high school, about personal finance because we want the next generation to be more financially literate than we are.

## What it does
Finfam is a website that allows you to learn about personal finance in a engaging way. Spending money, saving up money for future purchases, and making money are the three foundations of money management. Finafam supports account creation with email and password powered by Firebase so that all of your account information is safe. After you create an account Finfam gives you some money on account to begin with. Finfam has task managing feature where you can track your current tasks, set priority level and ultimately make money when you complete a task. After making some money you can check out our WishList feature! This feature lets you add items you want to purchase and helps you track your progress towards each item. 

## How we built it
We used HTML/CSS and React for the front end, and Firebase authentication. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had a variety of skill levels in the group, so we had too make sure everyone was up to date with the technologies we were working with. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how far we were able to get within 24 hours! We definitely learned a lot throughout the entire experience. 

## What we learned
We learned how to work together across varying timezones, as well as how to pick up and refine our skills in the tools and technologies we used! 

## What's next for FinFam
We had a lot of  ideas for Finfam and we couldn't implement them all due to the tight timeframe. We wanted to build our own rest API to save account on actual database as for now we are storing it in async storage.We’d also want to expand this into mobile app so that user can access his account from anywhere!  We also thought it would be cool to include a rewards system to benefit users that saved money.
